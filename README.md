# slothie

Slothie is a chatbot API built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Rivescript](https://www.rivescript.com/).

## Getting started

* Install Node, Mongo, and the Heroku toolbelt
* Clone this repo, and create a `.env` file with required variables
* `npm install`
* `sudo mongodb`
* `heroku local`
* Post to `http://localhost:5000/v1/chatbot`

### Running in Console

While Slothie is running locally, open a second terminal shell and run `node consolebot` to post to the `/chatbot` endpoint via console.
